# REST API CRUD with Node.js and Express üöÄ

This project is a full-stack Node.js application that utilizes the Express framework to create a REST API with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of building a REST API and interacting with data using Node.js and Express.

## Purpose üéØ

The primary purpose of this project is to provide a practical example of building a REST API using Node.js and Express. It aims to illustrate the process of creating endpoints for various CRUD operations, enabling data manipulation through HTTP requests.

## Features ‚ú®

This REST API CRUD project offers the following features:

- Create, read, update, and delete operations (CRUD) for data management
- RESTful API endpoints for seamless data access
- Node.js and Express framework for efficient server-side development

## Installation üîß
